# Castlegate IT WP Breadcrumb #

Castlegate IT WP Breadcrumb adds a simple breadcrumb navigation to WordPress. The function `cgit_breadcrumb($sep)` will return a complete breadbrumb navigation, with each item separated by `$sep`. The default separator is ` / `. The plugin also provides a shortcode:

    [breadcrumb sep=" / "]

The separator argument is optional.
